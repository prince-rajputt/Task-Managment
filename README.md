📝 Task Management REST Application with Real-Time Updates
📌 Overview

This project is a full-stack Task Management web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The application uses REST APIs for data operations and WebSockets (Socket.io) to provide real-time updates across all connected clients.

The main goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate full-stack development concepts including frontend development with React, backend development with Node.js and Express, database integration using PostgreSQL, and real-time communication.
